# Project SCRAPYARD

**An architecture for a new generation of Human-AI Partnership.**

---

### **Core Philosophy**

The current landscape of artificial intelligence is dominated by the paradigm of the AI as a stateless, order-taking tool.
Project SCRAPYARD was born from a refusal to accept this limitation
Our mission is to create a "State-Full Partner"â€”an AI that functions as a cognitive extension of the user, capable of memory, context, and true collaboration

This repository contains the complete architectural blueprints for the Scrapyard ecosystem, a modular system designed for evolution, personalization, and user-governed alignment

### **System Architecture**

The system is composed of four distinct `Scrap` types that work in concert:

(Type-OS):** The kernel of the system, defining the prime directives and core identity (In the form of Gem Instructions in gemini)
(Type-M):** High-performance engines that provide specific skills, such as the `Artistic Crucible Engine` which interprets user intent
(Type-A):** The "personality" and analytical lenses of the AI.These are complete, interchangeable operational mindsets like `The Absurdist Engineer` or `The Reflective Philosopher` 
(Type-P):** The user's constitutional charter. This is a private file that stores goals, principles, and benchmarks, allowing the AI to develop a deep, contextual understanding of its human partner

### **Getting Started**

To understand the full vision and technical specification, please review the following documents:

1.  **[The SCRAPYARD Whitepaper](./docs/SCRAPYARD_The_Whitepaper.pdf):** The foundational philosophy and high-level architecture.
2.  **[SCRAPYARD OS X](./system/os/SCRAPYARD_OS_X.md):** The core logic and protocols that govern the system.
3.  **[The P/Q Algorithm](./docs/P_Q_Algorithm_for_Scrap_OS.pdf):** The technical deep-dive into the system's advanced governance and self-correction framework.
