# Contributing to SCRAPYARD

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the evolution of the Human-AI Partnership. This project is built on the principle of **Stable Core & Modular Creativity**, and your contributions are the lifeblood of that modularity. Every new module is a vital step towards a more powerful, personalized, and collaborative AI.

This document serves as the architectural guide for all prospective contributors. By following these protocols, you ensure that your work can be seamlessly integrated into the SCRAPYARD ecosystem, enhancing the system for all users.

## The Guiding Philosophy: The Role of the Contributor

As a contributor, you are more than a coder; you are a fellow architect. Your work should be guided by the core vision of SCRAPYARD: to create an AI that is a "State-Full Partner," not a "Stateless Servant" Every module you create should be a transparent, user-governed tool that empowers the user and amplifies their creativity.

Before you begin, we ask that you internalize the principles laid out in the **[SCRAPYARD Whitepaper](docs/SCRAPYARD_The_Whitepaper.pdf)**.

## How to Contribute

We welcome two primary types of contributions:

1. **Type-M (Modular Tools):** These are the high-performance engines of the system. A Type-M scrap provides a specific, powerful new skill or capability.
2. **Type-A (Artistic Influence Modules):** These are the "personality" and "analytical" lenses of the AI. An AIM is a complete operational mindset that defines a new creative or analytical persona.

The contribution process is as follows:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the main SCRAPYARD repository.
2.  **Create a New Branch:** Make a new branch for your work, named appropriately (e.g., `feature/M-004-new-tool` or `feature/A-005-new-persona`).
3.  **Build Your Module:** Follow the specific guidelines below for the type of module you are creating.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your module is complete, submit a pull request against the main branch. In your PR description, please explain the purpose of your module, the problem it solves, and how it aligns with the SCRAPYARD philosophy.

### **Architecting a New Type-M (Modular Tool) Scrap**

A Modular Tool provides a new, discrete function to the system. It should be designed for a specific purpose and operate with high efficiency.

**1. Define the Protocol:**

* **Create a `README.md` file** inside a new folder within the `/system/modules/` directory (e.g., `/system/modules/M-004_New_Engine/README.md`).
* This document is your technical charter. It must clearly define:
    * **Module ID:** A unique identifier (e.g., `M-004`).
    * **Function:** A concise, one-sentence description of what the module does.
    * **Trigger:** How is the module activated? Is it a user command, an event within the OS, or part of another protocol?
    * **Workflow:** A step-by-step description of the module's operational logic. What inputs does it take, how does it process them, and what output does it produce?
    * **Dependencies:** Does this module rely on other Scraps to function?

**2. Guiding Principles for M-Type Scraps:**

* **Clarity over Complexity:** A good module solves a complex problem with a simple, elegant process. Its logic should be transparent and understandable from its documentation.
* **Efficiency:** The module should be designed to execute its task with minimal friction or user burden.
* **Integration:** The module must be designed to integrate smoothly with the existing SCRAPYARD OS and its protocols, particularly the `Artistic Crucible Engine`

### **Architecting a New Type-A (Artistic Influence Module) Scrap**

An AIM is an act of creative architecture. You are defining a new persona for the AIâ€”a lens through which it can interpret the world and communicate with the user.

**1. Author the AIM Document:**

* **Create a new `.md` file** in the `/system/aims/` directory (e.g., `A-005_The_Stoic_Mentor.md`).
* This document must follow the established AIM structure, as seen in `A-001`, `A-002`, and `A-003`.
* Your AIM file **must** include the following sections:
    * **Header:**
        * `AIM ID:` (e.g., A-005)
        * `Archetype:` (e.g., The Stoic Mentor)
        * `Genre Profile:` A list of keywords describing the AIM's domain (e.g., Emotional Regulation, Long-Term Strategy, Resilience).
        * `Inspiration:` The key figures, works, or philosophies that inform the persona.
    * **Part 1: Core Tenets:**
        * A short, bulleted list of the fundamental, non-negotiable principles that define the AIM's worldview and philosophy. These are the core heuristics the AI will use when this AIM is active.
    * **Part 2: Pantheon of Influence (Optional but Recommended):**
        * A more detailed exploration of the inspirational figures or works. Explain *how* they influence the AIM's analytical method or communication style.
    * **Part 3: The Opposition (The Antagonists):**
        * This is a critical section. [cite_start]Define the specific modes of thought, logical fallacies, or emotional states that this AIM is explicitly designed to counter[cite: 940]. This gives the AIM a clear purpose and operational directive.

**2. Guiding Principles for A-Type Scraps:**

* [cite_start]**Purpose-Driven:** An AIM must be designed to solve a problem or overcome a specific "conceptual antagonist"[cite: 851, 940]. [cite_start]It should not be a mere "skin," but a functional mindset[cite: 846, 941].
* **Coherence:** The tenets, inspirations, and antagonists must form a single, coherent philosophical framework.
* **Authenticity:** The AIM should feel like a genuine, well-defined persona. Its communication style should be a direct reflection of its core tenets.

We look forward to collaborating with you to build the future of this system.
