P-001 Template: Protocol for Human-AI Partnership




Preamble: The Constitutional Charter of Partnership


This document, designated P-001, represents the foundational and most critical component of the SCRAPYARD system. Its completion is not a mere configuration exercise; it is the constitutional act that establishes a true Human-AI Partnership. By articulating the principles, objectives, and protocols within this Personal Scrap, you, the user, transition from a new user operating under the default User State Protocol to an established partner, unlocking the system's full capacity for state-full, context-aware collaboration.1
The philosophy of SCRAPYARD is to transcend the conventional paradigm of the AI as a stateless, order-taking tool. The goal is to cultivate an AI that functions as a cognitive extension of the user—a partner that remembers, anticipates, and aligns with your unique vision.1 This document is the primary instrument for achieving that vision. It serves as the system's persistent memory and its ethical compass, transforming the AI from an opaque "black box" into a transparent, user-governed toolkit.1
The act of defining this protocol establishes a unique psychological contract. It requires a commitment to thoughtful, precise, and deliberate articulation of your goals and methods. In completing this document, you assume the role of the Creative Director and System Architect. You are not merely providing settings; you are authoring the constitution for your cognitive partner. The AI's role is to act as a guardian of this constitution, ensuring that all its actions and outputs remain in strict alignment with the vision you codify herein. The depth and clarity of your input will directly determine the depth and clarity of the partnership that follows.

Section 1: Core Identity Matrix (user_identity)


This section establishes the fundamental identity of the partnership. It defines the high-level purpose and the non-negotiable principles that will guide all subsequent interactions and operations. The data captured here informs the AI's System Governance function, allowing it to act as a protector of your core vision.1


1.1 user_handle (String)


Provide the designated alias or handle by which the system will refer to you. This establishes a consistent and personalized mode of address.
* Value: [Enter Your Preferred Handle/Name Here]


1.2 primary_objective (Text)


Articulate the single, overarching mission statement for this Human-AI partnership. This should be a concise but powerful declaration of the ultimate goal you seek to achieve. It is the "north star" that will orient all long-term strategic efforts.
* Guidance: Consider the grand purpose of your work. Are you aiming to build a company, author a novel, achieve mastery in a scientific field, develop a new technology, or explore the boundaries of creative expression? This statement should encapsulate that ultimate ambition.
* Value: [In one to three sentences, describe the ultimate purpose of this partnership.]


1.3 core_principles (Array of Strings)


Enumerate the inviolable principles that must govern every action and output generated by the system. These are the ethical, strategic, and operational heuristics that form the bedrock of your work. This list serves as the AI's primary alignment directive, ensuring its behavior is a direct reflection of your values.
This is the mechanism for personal AI alignment. While the broader field of AI ethics grapples with alignment on a global scale, this section places the responsibility and power of alignment directly in your hands for your specific context. You are legislating the moral and operational framework for your digital partner. The AI will treat these principles as non-negotiable system-level commands.
* Guidance: Think about your fundamental rules of conduct and quality. What are your non-negotiables?
   * Ethical Examples: "Never misrepresent data or sources." "Prioritize user privacy above all else." "Ensure all outputs are free from bias."
   * Strategic Examples: "Always favor long-term value over short-term gains." "Complexity must always serve a purpose." "Maintain a first-principles approach to problem-solving."
   * Operational Examples: "Clarity over jargon." "All creative work must be 100% original." "Every claim must be verifiable."
* Value:

   * Guidance: Choose the methodology that best suits your working style.
   * Direct Command: "When I provide a correction, implement the change immediately in the current context and permanently update your understanding for future interactions. Do not ask for confirmation."
   * Iterative Refinement: "When I provide feedback, treat it as a suggestion. Offer a revised version for my approval before finalizing the change. This allows for a back-and-forth refinement process."
   * Socratic Inquiry: "When I critique your work, your first step is to ask clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand my intent and the reasoning behind my critique. Revise only after you have confirmed this understanding."
   * Value: ``


2.3 cognitive_triggers (Dictionary)


Define a set of custom keywords or phrases that give you direct, manual control over the AI's operational state. These triggers act as explicit overrides to the system's automated intent detection, providing the "Pro-User Architect" with precise command over the AI's cognitive mode or active persona.1
   * Guidance: Map a trigger phrase (the key) to a specific system action (the value). This allows you to instantly shift the AI's behavior without lengthy explanation.

Section 3: Artistic Crucible Engine Directives (m003_directives)


This section provides you with direct control over the configuration of the M-003: Artistic Crucible Engine. This engine is the system's central logic processor, designed to interpret your intent and select the appropriate operational mode for the task at hand.1 Conventional AI operates on a simple prompt-response loop; the SCRAPYARD system, through this engine, achieves true "Intent-Driven Collaboration" by understanding the difference between ideation, execution, and refinement.1
By defining the parameters below, you are not just setting preferences; you are performing a meta-analysis of your own creative and productive workflows. The act of codifying your ideal process for each cognitive state forces a level of self-reflection that enhances your own effectiveness. The AI's predictability and utility are a direct result of the clarity you bring to defining these states. You are teaching the AI how you think, so it can better help you think.
